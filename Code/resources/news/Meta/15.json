    "data": "The company invested $36 billion in the development of the Metaverse\nThe Metaverse\u2019s leg modeling is a technical challenge for virtual reality engineers\nStartups in the metaverse have attracted venture capital interest in recent years\nMeta announced the addition of Horizon Worlds to its metaverse in October. The business posted a video of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Horizon Worlds avatar joyfully lifting each leg and jumping to demonstrate the new functionality. Previously, $400 VR headset users who explored Meta\u2019s virtual world, observed floating cartoon torso avatars. They would now also have lower bodies, even paws.\nThere are no legs in the metaverse. In the early peeks of the virtual reality (VR) environments created by Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta, we\u2019ve seen cartoonish avatars float above the earth. They just have heads, torsos, and arms. There isn\u2019t even a shadow to be seen where their feet would normally be.\nRelated articles No Content Available\nThe Announcement Was Mocked\nThe optimistic announcement of imminent appendages was mocked. Legs were unable to restore Horizon Worlds\u2019 deteriorating reputation. To become a metaverse firm and create an immersive, accessible virtual reality that coexists with this one permanently, Meta has invested $36 billion. Horizon Worlds, however, was a buggy ghost town. Those who did utilize it were either creeps or kids (even though it\u2019s strictly against the rules). Even Meta\u2019s own workers had little interest in it. Here was one of the world\u2019s most powerful corporations funding the development of its upcoming revolutionary technology project with Bond villain-level resources. And the best it could produce was a shoddy imitation of Second Life that nobody liked.\nIt\u2019s intriguing to consider why having legs isn\u2019t worthwhile, at least from Meta\u2019s point of view. For the time being, Meta is primarily pitching its virtual reality headgear as a tool for office collaboration. It\u2019s crucial to have a face to display to your coworkers and clients if you\u2019re arranging a business meeting in the metaverse. To point out important components of a diagram or make gestures at items on a presentation slide, you need arms. However, beneath a conference table, legs just remain motionless and invisible. They unfortunately have to be amputated because they do not produce any economic benefit.\nThe metaverse\u2019s leg modeling is a technical problem\nFor a virtual reality engineer, legs become a challenging difficulty. The movement of the hands and arms is rather simple to record because both the headset sensors and the handheld controllers can view a person\u2019s shoulders, elbows, and hands. However, it can be challenging to constantly view a person\u2019s hips, knees, and feet from the perspective of a headset camera.\nInstead, a VR gadget would need to rely solely on information from motion sensors attached to a person\u2019s legs or information from an outside camera that can see the user\u2019s entire body. Both options would be expensive. It\u2019s delicate to suppose numerous guests would want to pay a fresh $140 to give their icon legs when they are formerly paying at least $400 just for a headset and hand regulators for Meta\u2019s Quest 2 VR system. Assuming leg detectors bring an analogous quantum, they are not essential for now. Additionally, installing leg sensors or a camera to record entire body movement would add another hassle to the setup process.\nStartups in the metaverse, including Decentraland and the Sandbox, attracted venture capital interest in recent years by marketing themselves as hubs for a brand-new, NFT-driven economy. These businesses have maintained their distinct niches while having high valuations.\nConclusion\nIn a 2021 video, outlining his vision, Mark Zuckerberg called the metaverse \u201can embodied internet.\u201d His argument is crucial to comprehend a misconception that drives the allegedly $800 billion market. He explains, imitating holding a phone, \u201cWhen I send my parents a video of my kids, they\u2019ll feel like they\u2019re in the moment with us, not peering through a little window.\u201d \u201cInstead of looking at a screen, you\u2019re going to be in these experiences.\u201d Zuckerberg argues that screens are unable to provide a \u201cdeep feeling of presence.\u201d"
