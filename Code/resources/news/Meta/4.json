They concurred with measures like watermarking and the bloc\u2019s risk-based strategy, according to Breton\n\u201cI really appreciate the European institution here, and the foresight on taking this issue so seriously, for the rest of the world, too.\u201d, said Altman, the CEO of OpenAI\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWe look forward to working with you to be running well in advance and offering a European service in compliance with the European market,\u201d Altman added.\nNick Clegg is Meta\u2019s President of global affairs. He said that his company \u201cshared our support for the objectives of the AI Pact. While we need to study the details, we recognize it\u2019s important for tech companies to be open about the work they\u2019re doing on AI & engage collaboratively across the industry, governments & civil society.\u201d\nBreton visited many IT firms this week as part of his trip, which included the conversations on Friday. The owner of Facebook and Instagram, according to Breton, appears well-prepared to comply with Europe\u2019s new stringent content moderation regulations after his visit to Meta, but will submit to a stress test of its systems next month.\nAdvertisement\nIn the middle of July, Zuckerberg consented to a trial to evaluate how the firm applies content control guidelines. According to Breton, Meta has about 1,000 employees working on DSA implementation. This meeting, thus, presents a lot of hope regarding the future of digital content regulations."
