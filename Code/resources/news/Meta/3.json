Over the past year, Zuckerberg has appeared on podcasts hosted by provocateur Joe Rogan and AI researcher Lex Fridman, both popular among fans of Twitter owner Musk. He has posted sweaty action shots on Instagram displaying his jujitsu skills. And this week, he accepted Musk\u2019s challenge to a cage fight after news reports on Meta creating a Twitter competitor. The pair have agreed to fight at the \u201cVegas Octagon,\u201d an Ultimate Fighting Championship arena, although it\u2019s unclear if and when it will take place.\nThe strategy to pitch Zuckerberg as visionary innovator to a tech-savvy audience losing its enthusiasm for his social media empire has been years in the making, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters. But Zuckerberg has really ramped it up over the past year, one of the people said, courting the same \u201ctech bros\u201d who have been captivated by Musk \u2014 who is suddenly Zuckerberg\u2019s competition in more ways than one.\nAs Meta struggles with layoffs and its so far unrealized dreams of the metaverse, \u201cI think Mark is also getting a feeling that he is not respected,\u201d said Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School. The cage match was \u201ca way for him to show that, \u2018Look, he is edgy. He can be a tech bro just like the next guy.\u2019\u201d\nAdvertisement\nI\u2019m up for a cage match if he is lol \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 21, 2023\nAdvertisement\nMeta has long understood that Zuckerberg is more synonymous with his product than other Big Tech company leaders and even conducted polling on the CEO\u2019s likability and whether Facebook\u2019s best days were behind it, said one of the people familiar with the company\u2019s communications strategy. Zuckerberg, in particular, is sensitive to being perceived as an innovator and interested in what the public thinks.\nMeta\u2019s communications relations team has been positioning him as the company\u2019s chief storyteller in recent years, announcing many of the company\u2019s products directly, the people said. That has also meant putting him in front of journalists and influencers they perceive as influential with early adopters and the tech workforce. This shift also coincided with the company\u2019s plans to rename itself Meta and Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to elevate Global Affairs President Nick Clegg to be the company\u2019s main content moderation defender.\nAdvertisement\nIn recent weeks, Zuckerberg has also sought to win back the support of his workers, following tens of thousands of layoffs. The CEO has defended his leadership internally, arguing that he should be judged on whether the company is making progress toward its business goals. And he has spent more time lately talking about the company\u2019s new product investments in artificial intelligence with the goal that they might become more excited about where the company is headed.\nZuckerberg has turned to Instagram to try to promote that edgier image. Three weeks ago, he posted a selfie sporting a camouflaged vest, announcing that he had just completed the \u201cMurph challenge,\u201d a popular exercise challenge that requires a heavy dose of running, pull-ups, push-ups and squats while wearing a 20-pound weighted pack.\nJujitsu, within the last couple of years, has also taken top billing. After it was reported that Zuckerberg was choked unconscious during one of his matches, the CEO contacted the New York Times to deny that it happened, according to the newspaper.\nIn 2021, he posted a video of himself hover-boarding with an American flag on July 4.\n\u201cThese founders \u2026 are wanting to drive their story directly,\u201d said Brooke Hammerling, a public relations consultant for technology companies. \u201cThe CEO story can become bigger than the company itself.\u201d\nWhile Zuckerberg and Musk share many traits as tech CEOs, their public images have diverged from each other in recent years.\nZuckerberg\u2019s image has suffered setbacks after a long stretch of scandals and policy fights over Facebook\u2019s content moderation practices. More recently, Meta has faced major problems at its business that have kneecapped the company\u2019s growth. Its core blue app is losing its appeal among younger audiences who favor newer apps Snapchat and TikTok. Sluggish post-pandemic growth in e-commerce has cut into the company\u2019s advertising business. An Apple change in privacy settings was estimated to have cost the company billions.\nMeanwhile, Zuckerberg\u2019s big bet on virtual and augmented reality appears years away from making money, and Meta has been slow to build products in generative artificial intelligence, which has already transformed the technology industry.\nMusk, on the other hand, is the richest man in the world, thanks in large part to his stake in Tesla, where he is the CEO. His rocket ship company, SpaceX, has won major government contracts, and his decision to buy Twitter last year and pledge to the right to free speech on the social media platform won accolades from different corners of the tech sector.\nMusk\u2019s penchant for tweeting at odd hours and trolling his critics \u2014 as well as his crusade against \u201ccancel culture\u201d and the \u201cwoke mind virus\u201d \u2014 attracted political conservatives and leaders from within Silicon Valley\u2019s reactionary right. More of the contrarian tech crowd followed when Musk slashed Twitter\u2019s workforce, demanded a return to office and promised to build a \u201cbased\u201d alternative to \u201cwoke\u201d AI, borrowing a compliment from extremely online factions of Twitter.\nThe two billionaires have long sparred in public. In 2016, Zuckerberg criticized Musk after a SpaceX rocket exploded and destroyed one of Facebook\u2019s satellites that was part of a project to expand internet connectivity around the world. A year later, the two traded barbs over their differing perspectives on the risks of artificial intelligence. In recent years, Musk has also advocated for deleting Facebook and criticized the platform\u2019s role in facilitating the riots at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\nNow, the two CEOs are gearing up for another battle. Meta is exploring building a decentralized social media network as an alternative to Twitter, the news that prompted the challenge to battle from Musk.\nHappy July 4th! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Sunday, July 4, 2021\n\u201cI think there is another aspect to the viral cage match between the two, which is now many more people are aware of the fact that Facebook wants to start a Twitter alternative. And they are going to want to check it out when it\u2019s announced,\u201d Chakravorti said. \u201cSo this is free advertising.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nZuckerberg\u2019s commitment to the rivalry may continue to be tested.\nAfter Zuckerberg won two medals at his first jujitsu tournament in May, he went on Fridman\u2019s podcast to discuss his interest in the sport and vision for Meta. The two men geeked out on jujitsu, trading opinions on why it\u2019s such a difficult sport and what they have learned about life from participating.\nFridman also pressed Zuckerberg to say something he thinks Musk has done right at Twitter. Zuckerberg said Musk\u2019s decision to make drastic cuts and changes to the company\u2019s workforce emboldened other tech leaders \u2014 including himself \u2014 who might have been hesitant before to follow suit.\n\u201cIt was probably good for the industry that he made those changes,\u201d Zuckerberg said."
