    "data": "WhatsApp, the go-to messaging app for millions around the world, is working on a new feature that lets users check messages and make calls from Meta Quest, the company\u2019s virtual reality headset.\nMeta Quest and WhatsApp Account Linkage\nA recent report by WABetaInfo suggests that the developers are working on the ability to link Meta Quest to an existing WhatsApp account. The new feature was spotted on WhatsApp beta for Android 2.23.13.6 but is currently unavailable to those on the beta version of the app.\nOnce you link your existing WhatsApp account to Meta Quest, the virtual reality headset will show up in the list of connected devices. This means the upcoming feature might use the recently introduced Companion Mode that lets users use one WhatsApp account on up to four devices.\nFeature Under Development\nWhile it is still unclear how the integration will work, speculations suggest that it might be similar to the hands-free feature for Ray-Ban stories, which automatically reads messages and lets users make end-to-end encrypted calls. The feature is currently under development, so we will have to wait a while before being able to see how it works and what functionalities it brings to the table.\nEarlier this month, just days before the launch of Apple\u2019s Vision Pro Mixed Reality headset, Meta announced Quest 3, the company\u2019s most affordable mixed reality headset for $499.\nMeta\u2019s upcoming Quest 3 headset is a Mixed Reality (MR) headset using Meta Reality tech but also supports Virtual Reality (VR) so it can be used for both types of games and apps.\nIndeed, the part of Meta formerly known as Oculus says we\u2019ll learn more about it at the company\u2019s Meta Connect showcase on 27 September so expect the Quest 3 release date to be soon after that."
