    "data": "Today's slice of meta is hot out of the oven from The Pizza Underground and features Macaulay Culkin wearing a T-shirt with a picture of Ryan Gosling wearing a Macaulay Culkin T-shirt.\nStill with us? The Pizza Underground is Culkin's New York-based band that covers Velvet Underground songs with a nod toward pizza, like \"Take a Bite of the Wild Slice.\" The photo in question came from the band's Twitter account, @cheesedayz, and also show's Culkin mugging with a pizza-adorned coffee mug. He's wearing the same sunglasses as Gosling.\nGosling, star of \"The Notebook\" and \"Hey, Girl\" memes everywhere, showed up in the \"Home Alone\"-era Culkin shirt about a year ago when he was snapped pumping gas in Studio City, Calif. The two former child actors were born just a few months apart in 1980 and are both 33 now.\nThe Pizza Underground also shares assorted photos, artwork and GIFs over on Tumblr. And in December, a YouTube video of Culkin eating a slice of pizza in front of the camera racked up more than 1.4 million views.\nFollow Kurt Schlosser on Google+\n\n\n\n"
