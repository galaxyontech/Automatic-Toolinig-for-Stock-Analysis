    "data_content": "Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced plans to lay off another 10,000 workers and close 5,000 open roles this spring. Furthermore, employees who were previously designated as remote will be required to come in three days a week beginning in September. Over the past two years, a number of companies, such as Amazon, AT&T, BlackRock, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Citigroup, and Google, have also put in place mandates requiring employees to physically attend the office a certain number of days each week. Employees are speculating these requirements could be a way to retain corporate tax advantages or to bring about unannounced layoffs.\n"
