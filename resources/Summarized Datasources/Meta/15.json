    "data_content": "Meta developed its metaverse, Horizon Worlds, through a $36 billion investment. The company unveiled its avatar's ability to have legs during Horizon Worlds' demonstration. This development presented a technical challenge for virtual reality engineers due to difficulties in tracking leg movements. Despite this announcement, Horizon Worlds had declining reputation due to various criticisms including lack of interest from Meta employees. Additionally, the requirement for VR equipment and motion sensors presented cost and setup challenges for users. Nonetheless, other metaverse startups such as Decentraland and Sandbox have attracted venture capital by positioning themselves as hubs for a new, NFT-based economy.\n"
