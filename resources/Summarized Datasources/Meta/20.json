    "data_content": "In response to Canada's new Online News Act\u2014requiring tech platforms to pay news publishers for their content\u2014Meta has decided to block Canadian access to news on Facebook and Instagram. The company, which had been vocal in its opposition to the bill, says it believes the payment requirement is \"unworkable.\" The move follows a similar tactic employed by Meta in Australia after that country passed laws demanding payment for news, a decision later watered down. Critics argue such legislation supports local journalism and independent news outlets; many are watching to see if other countries follow suit.\n"
