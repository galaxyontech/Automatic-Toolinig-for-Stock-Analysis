    "data_content": "Many technology companies in Austin have slashed jobs in recent years, but the full extent of job losses is unclear due to a lack of required reporting. The federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act mandates that certain layoffs and workplace closures be publicly reported, but companies are often not required to report every instance of slashed jobs due to complex regulations. Some companies may also choose to ignore the reporting regulations due to a relatively toothless enforcement policy for violators of the WARN Act. Despite these challenges, tens of thousands of layoffs have been reported in Texas in recent years, with 2,500 job losses in Central Texas alone in 2023."
