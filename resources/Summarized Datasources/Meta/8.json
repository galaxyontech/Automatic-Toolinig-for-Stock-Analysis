    "data_content": "Meta has lowered the minimum age requirement for its Quest virtual reality headset from 13 to 10 years old, enabling younger children to have their own account. Parents can control the apps their children download and accounts have additional protections such as automatic privacy settings. Last year Meta introduced parental controls including monitoring screen time and the possibility of approving or blocking apps. The company is expected to release the Quest 3 later this fall which will have improved design and new controllers with a focus on mixed reality."
