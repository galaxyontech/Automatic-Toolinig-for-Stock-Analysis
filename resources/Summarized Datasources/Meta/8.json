    "data_content": "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is struggling to compete in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) due to the loss of a significant number of its AI investigators and researchers. In 2013, CEO Mark Zuckerberg recruited experts to help Meta advance in the AI area. However, after recent layoffs and the cancellation of projects, the company has suffered a lack of confidence from its employees, with only 26% expressing faith in the firm's leadership as of a survey conducted in April-May. Despite these setbacks, Zuckerberg has praised his employees for recent advances in AI and named 2023 the \"Year of Efficiency\" as they continue to develop generic AI.\n"
