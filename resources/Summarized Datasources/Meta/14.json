    "data_content": "The NOYB European Centre for Digital Rights is asking for Ireland's data-protection watchdog to investigate its complaints about Meta's (formerly Facebook) handling of user data. NOYB argues that Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram each purported to rely on users' consent to process personal data under article 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation. The NOYB group is asking the High Court to declare that the Data Protection Commission failed to carry out its investigation within a reasonable time frame and to direct the DPC to investigate further complaints.\n"
