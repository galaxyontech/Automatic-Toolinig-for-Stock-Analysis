    "data_content": "The Malaysian government announced plans to take legal action against Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, due to its failure to remove \"undesirable\" content from the platform. The country's Communications and Multimedia Commission stated that Facebook had not taken sufficient action despite repeated requests, on issues including race, religion, defamation, and scam advertisements. The commission indicated that legal action is necessary to promote accountability and consumer protection and suggested that Facebook could face charges under Malaysia's Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 for facilitating and aiding criminal activity."
