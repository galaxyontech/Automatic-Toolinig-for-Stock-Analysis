    "data_content": "Four former Facebook employees, human rights groups, industry observers and lobbyists have told the Washington Post that the social media giant has been making repeated concessions to the Vietnamese government, censoring dissent and allowing those seen as threats to be forced off the platform. Since Facebook\u2019s popularity exploded in the country, the government has repeatedly demanded greater restrictions, leading to the company adopting an internal list of Vietnamese Communist Party officials who should not be criticized on Facebook, the former employees said. The list is unique to Vietnam in East Asia, they added. More than 70% of Vietnam\u2019s 97 million people use Facebook to share content, operate businesses and send messages.\n"
