    "data_content": "Meta Platforms (the parent company of Facebook and Instagram) has seen a 134% increase in its stock price this year through a combination of cost reduction efforts and growth in ad revenues driven by the use of AI, which optimises ad performance and targets the right audience. Analysts believe that Meta\u2019s investments in AI, new products, and adtech could drive the stock higher in H2 2023. Meanwhile, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike has reported better-than-expected Q1 results with a 42% YoY increase in revenue, while Nvidia has also rallied, thanks to the buzz around AI and investor sentiment.
