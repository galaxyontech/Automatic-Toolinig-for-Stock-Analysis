    "data_content": "Meta, led by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is facing challenges in the field of AI as it falls behind rivals such as OpenAI. The company has lost at least one-third of its AI researchers, causing issues with its ability to compete in AI innovation. Some of the researchers quit due to exhaustion, while others raised doubts about Meta's goals in AI. Meta has also faced a drop in trust, as it was not invited to the White House's recent meeting on \"companies at the forefront of AI innovation.\" An internal study revealed that only 26% of Meta employees trust the company's leadership. Employees are now encouraging the company to correct prior mistakes and shift back towards generative AI."
