    "data_content": "Meta has developed a new speech generation tool called \"Voicebox\" that can create convincing speech in multiple languages and styles with an error rate of 5.9%, significantly better than its rivals Vall-E. The tool was developed using a new model called \"Flow Matching\" and was trained on 50,000 hours of speech and transcripts, allowing it to be given a short audio recording and fill in the speech from context. However, while the tool has numerous potential use cases, Meta has declined to release it due to concerns about its potential for misuse and the risks it poses."
