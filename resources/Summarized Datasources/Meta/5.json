    "data_content": "The Malaysian government is planning to take legal action against Meta, Facebook's parent company, for failing to remove content considered harmful in relation to race and religion. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) made a statement stating that despite their requests, Meta did not sufficiently address the issue of inappropriate content on its platform. The Malaysian administration criticized Meta's slow and unsatisfactory responses. Communications and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil wants to meet with Meta to discuss potential policy amendments and ensure compliance with regulations. The MCMC also aims to expand its authority on matters related to communications and multimedia."
