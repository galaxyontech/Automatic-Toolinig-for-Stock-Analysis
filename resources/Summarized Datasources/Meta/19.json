    "data_content": "After Canada enacted the Online News Act, which obligates platforms like Facebook and Instagram to pay news publishers for reproducing their content, Meta is blocking access to news on those platforms for Canadians. Meta had previously voiced its opposition to the Act, and had threatened to cut off news access to Canadians. According to the company, the payment arrangement stipulated in the Act is \"unworkable\". This decision by Meta will not affect other features on its platforms. In the past, Meta had similarly blocked news access for Australian users when the country tried to pass laws on journalism, but later restored those services when the government made amendments to the laws in Meta and Google's favor.\n"
