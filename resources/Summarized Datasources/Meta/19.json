    "data_content": "Meta Platforms' stocks have tripled off their lows last year and are still seen as having further upside potential by some analysts. Despite being the hottest \"FAANG\" member of late, Meta is not considered to be trading above and beyond its peers. Trailing PE at 34.9 times is considered reasonable by some, although it is higher than the company's five-year historical average of 24.2. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's track record of developing technology and his willingness to experiment with cutting-edge new technologies make him a force to be reckoned with. Project 92, the company's rival to Twitter, may be the last piece to make its social-business complete."
