Meta intends to promote Threads within Instagram, aiming to attract \"tens of millions\" of users within months. The company is reportedly appealing to major celebrities to join Threads as a \"sanely run\" platform, positioning itself as a more responsible alternative to Twitter. Threads is being touted as a \"decentralized\" social media network with potential integrations with the social media platform Mastodon. The announcement has sparked a war of words between Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter owner Elon Musk.\n"
