    "data_content": "Following the approval of an online news bill by the Canadian parliament, Meta announced it will restrict news access for its Canadian users. The law requires tech companies like Meta and Google to enter contracts and pay news organisations for content shared on their platforms. Previously in 2021, Facebook Australia reinstated news content after government negotiations resulted in policy changes. Meta described the Canadian law as \"fundamentally flawed,\" but further discussions with Facebook and Google are planned. The government argues the act, expected to be implemented within six months, will enhance fairness in the digital news market and ensure fair compensation for news. Independent estimates suggest news businesses could receive about C$329 million annually from digital platforms."
