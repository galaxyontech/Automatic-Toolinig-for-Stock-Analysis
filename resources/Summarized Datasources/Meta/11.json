    "data_content": "Meta Platforms' shares have increased by more than 133% since the beginning of the year, making it the best performer in the FAANG group of stocks. However, the author believes that a lot of the firm's previously indicated recovery potential has now been realized and shares are vulnerable to a correction. Meta Platforms is no longer undervalued based on free cash flow, and the EPS estimate trend has also reversed. The author thinks it is a good time to lock in profits. The rise of short-term video platforms is seen as a serious risk to Meta Platforms, as its user base is aging, and younger people move to fresher social media apps."
