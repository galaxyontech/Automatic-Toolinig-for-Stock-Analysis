    "data_content": "WhatsApp is reportedly working on a feature that will allow users to check messages and make calls from Meta Quest, the company's virtual reality headset. The new feature was spotted in the beta version of WhatsApp for Android but is not yet available. The feature, upon linking an existing WhatsApp account to Meta Quest, will allow the headset to appear in the list of connected devices. The integration might function similarly to the hands-free feature for Ray-Ban stories. The company announced its most affordable mixed reality headset, Quest 3, earlier this month. The headset supports both Virtual and Mixed Reality. Further details are expected to be shared at the Meta Connect showcase in September."
