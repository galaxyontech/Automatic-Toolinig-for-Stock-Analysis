    "data_content": "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has lost a third of its AI researchers who have published work, according to the Wall Street Journal. The researchers left due to burnout and a lack of confidence in the direction of the company. Meta is attempting to keep pace with industry leaders such as OpenAI in the AI space. CEO Mark Zuckerberg invested heavily in AI, but the company is losing ground due to layoffs and researcher departures. Meta was excluded from the White House's AI leadership summit in May. The company is trying to address past missteps and bring its focus back on generative AI."
